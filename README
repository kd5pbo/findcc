findcc
------

findcc searches for sequences of an arbitrary number of ascii digits followed
by a single ascii digit that is the sum of the found digits modulus 10.  If no
filename is given, the standard input is used.  The offset in the file and
line number where the number was found, as well as the number with its check
digit are printed in a tabular format, separated by whitespace.

Usage findcc [-q] [-n] [filename]

Options:
  -n=15: Length of number to find, not including the check digit.
  -q=false: Be quiet; don't print the header.

Test Data
---------

The file testdata contains test data.  It is mostly random bytes, interspersed
with known good (and somewhat contrived) 15+1 digit numbers.  The output is
intended to be:

OFFSET  LINE    NUMBER
  1024     5    1234567890123450
  2064    10    1122334455667784
  3104    18    9876543219876544
  3105    18    8765432198765449

Perl Hack
-----------

The following is a perl hack to calculate the checksum of a 15-digit number.
It is useful in verifying the output of findcc.

perl -E 'say+length(join("",map{"x"x$_}split//,$ARGV[0]))%10if$ARGV[0]=~/\d{15}/' 876543219876544

The output should be 9.
